# Using LIDA with LLMs

!LIDA and LLMs

This repository explores the integration of LIDA (Language-Independent Document Analysis) with Large Language Models (LLMs). LIDA provides tools for document analysis, summarization, and information extraction, while LLMs enhance natural language understanding and generation.

## Overview

- **What is LIDA?**: LIDA is an open-source library for analyzing and summarizing text documents. It includes features such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.
- **Why Combine with LLMs?**: By combining LIDA's document analysis capabilities with LLMs' language understanding, we can create powerful research assistants, chatbots, and content summarizers.
- **Getting Started**: Follow these steps to use LIDA with LLMs:

    1. **Install Dependencies**: Set up LIDA and any LLM libraries you plan to use.
    2. **Preprocess Documents**: Use LIDA to preprocess your text data (e.g., remove stopwords, extract keywords).
    3. **Leverage LLMs**: Integrate LLMs (such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4) for tasks like summarization or question answering.
    4. **Fine-Tuning**: Customize LLM behavior based on your specific use case.

## Examples

- **Document Summarization**: Use LIDA to preprocess a research paper, then generate a concise summary using an LLM.
- **Chatbot with Context**: Combine LIDA's named entity recognition with LLMs to create context-aware chatbots.
